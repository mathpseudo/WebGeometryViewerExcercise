The html file contains basic shapes like sphere, cube, torus and cylinder.Operations like rotation, zooming in, zooming out etc. can be carried out.

Zooming factor - 1.25
Rotation(in x & y directions only) - 0.1

The positions of the shapes are static, but that can be changed. This is only a basic version. I am trying to make mouse interactions possible but from those in a few examples I have seen online, I personally find interacting with the mouse a little difficult. So currently the project uses html buttons.

I would also like to add a few complex shapes and see their interactions.
